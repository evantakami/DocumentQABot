## Project Overview üßæ

**DocumentQABot** is a system that allows users to engage in a Q&A conversation based on the content of an uploaded Markdown file. The system is built using `langchain` and `Gradio`, supporting both online and local language models. Users can upload a file, and the system will automatically parse and split the document into searchable chunks, using an embedding model to create a vector store that facilitates context-based answers.

Key features include:
- **File Upload and Processing**: Users can upload Markdown files, and the system will process and split the content into searchable chunks.
- **Q&A Functionality**: The system provides context-based answers to user questions based on the uploaded document, supporting both local and online models.
- **Conversation History**: The system keeps a record of recent conversations, allowing users to view previous interactions.
- **Gradio Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with Gradio, making it easy to upload files and input questions.

## Functionality Overview üí°

1. **File Upload and Processing**:
   - Users upload a Markdown file, and the system reads and splits the content.
   - The document is split using the `CharacterTextSplitter` from `langchain`, generating searchable chunks of content.
   - After splitting, the document is embedded into vector space for retrieval during the Q&A process.

2. **Q&A Functionality**:
   - Users input questions, and the system generates answers based on the document content and context.
   - Two modes are available for generating answers:
     - **Online Mode**: Using `ChatOpenAI` and the `gpt-4o-mini` model.
     - **Local Mode**: Using the custom Ollama model (e.g., `Llama-3-ELYZA-JP-8B`).
   - The system retrieves relevant document chunks to provide context for answering questions.

3. **Vector Store**:
   - The document content is embedded using `HuggingFace`'s `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model and stored in a `FAISS` vector store for efficient retrieval.

4. **Conversation History**:
   - The system maintains a conversation history, keeping track of the last 10 exchanges to provide context for ongoing interactions.

5. **Web UI**:
   - The web interface is built using `Gradio`, allowing users to easily upload files, input questions, and interact with the system.
   - The UI is simple and intuitive, with sections for file upload, question input, answer display, conversation history, and retrieved document chunks.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **LangChain**: For document processing, splitting, embedding, and retrieval functionality, supporting the creation of a Q&A chain (RetrievalQA).
- **HuggingFace Embeddings**: To embed document content into vector space for efficient retrieval.
- **FAISS**: Used to store and quickly retrieve embedded document vectors.
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Used as the online language model for Q&A processing.
- **Ollama Local Model**: Supports localized question-answer processing (e.g., `Llama-3-ELYZA-JP-8B` model).
- **Gradio**: For building a user-friendly web interface that enables easy interaction with the system.
